### about

q is a queueing framework. the idea behind it is to provide a universal application interface that can be used across all
development phases and scaling requirements. q runs on multiple back-ends and has binding to many programing languages. and so
while during development you probably want to run it using an in-memory back-end that clears with the process, you may choose 
to use redis on your test environment and amazon SQS on production.

##### back-ends support
* in-memory (non persistent, designed for development)
* berkeley db
* redis

##### languages support
* node.js
* java
* scala
